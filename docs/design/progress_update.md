## Backend Progress

As of this update, most read-only controllers and services have been added for the entities listed in `database_schema.md`. Write operations now cover reviews, blogs, comments, likes, favorites and follows. Only unit tests remain to be implemented.

Additional controllers for canteen and stall types provide basic list and detail endpoints. 

With all controllers, mappers and services now sketched out, including write
operations for likes, favorites and follows, the remaining admin modules have
also been planned. The design phase for the backend is therefore considered
**complete** with implementation coverage near **100%**. Unit tests still need
to be written in a future phase.
